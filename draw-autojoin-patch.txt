Plan: Update draw.html to auto-join 'public-room' on load and remove room input UI.

Edits to make:
- Remove the <input id="roomId"> and Connect/Leave buttons HTML
- On load, call connectToRoomWithId('public-room') which will set up ws and join the room
- Modify connectToRoom to accept a room parameter and not read from DOM when called programmatically
- Hide the Status text or keep it but auto-update
- Ensure that incoming non-signal messages (draw/draw_partial) are applied from ws.onmessage as well

I'll now apply these edits.
